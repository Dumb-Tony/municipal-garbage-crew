# Municipal Garbage Crew

A living design package and standalone browser vertical slice for a tactile, systemic sanitation-route game.

> **Play online:** [Launch Municipal Garbage Crew](https://dumb-tony.github.io/municipal-garbage-crew/)

## Play

Open `prototype/index.html` in a modern desktop browser. No install, server, or build step is required.

Drive and walk with **WASD** or **arrow keys**. Stop near a curb and press **F** to exit the truck. On foot, press **Space** to inspect or load and **E** to grab/release bins, bags, and oversized waste. Hold **Space** with **A/D** to balance a bin lift; hold **Shift** to brace an awkward oversized item. Return empty bins to their amber markers. Use **R** to tag contamination, **Q** to check uncertain waste, **C** to compact, **X** to recover spills or ruptured bags, and **P** to pause.

## Project map

- `prototype/` — playable Canvas prototype
- `docs/GDD.md` — living game design document and decision log
- `docs/ART_DIRECTION.md` — canonical visual language, palette, lighting, UI, and asset rules
- `docs/BUILD_PREP.md` — backlog, milestones, specifications, acceptance criteria, and QA
- `docs/PLAYTEST.md` — lightweight playtest form

## Current slice

Version `0.11.0` adds the solo-validation kit. Persistent shift setup now includes a score-neutral relaxed clock, forgiving handling, light traffic, reduced camera shake, and high contrast. Each completed or abandoned shift produces a copyable report with the seed, assists, onboarding times, route order, mistakes, recovery, outcome, and progression state so playtests can be compared instead of judged from memory. The persistent depot, address history, upgrades, and consequences remain intact. The game remains browser-first; Unity is not part of the plan.

## Repository and publishing policy

- Canonical local checkout: `C:\Dev\municipal-garbage-crew`
- Primary branch: `main`
- Public repository name: `municipal-garbage-crew`
- The browser prototype is published with GitHub Pages from the `main` branch root; the root page forwards directly into `prototype/`.
- The living GDD and implementation plans remain versioned with the source.
- Secrets, credentials, machine-specific files, dependencies, and generated junk must not be committed.
